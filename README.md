FourQ
=====

A reimplementation of Microsoft's FourQlib, implementing their FourQ elliptic
curve construct.  This implementation is focused on readability and correctness,
vs. performance.  Python is used due to the availability of arbitrary-precision
arithmetic by default.

Quickstart
----------

```
> python curve4q.py
