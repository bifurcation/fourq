FourQ
=====

A reimplementation of Microsoft's
[FourQlib](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fourqlib/), implementing
their [FourQ](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/565.pdf) elliptic curve construct.
This implementation is focused on readability and correctness, vs. performance.
Python is used due to the availability of arbitrary-precision arithmetic by
default.

Quickstart
----------

```
> python curve4q.py
```
