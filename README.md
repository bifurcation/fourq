FourQ
=====

A reimplementation of Microsoft's [FourQlib][1], implementing their [FourQ][2]
elliptic curve construct.  This implementation is focused on readability and
correctness, vs. performance.  Python is used due to the availability of
arbitrary-precision arithmetic by default.

Quickstart
----------

```
> python curve4q.py
```
